# Collisions-report
# Abstract The objective of this project is to thoroughly examine crash reporting data from Montgomery County, focussing on three different datasets that offer valuable insights into drivers, incidents, and police dispatch records. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the goal is to uncover significant patterns and information that can ultimately improve traffic safety measures and law enforcement strategies.
Dataset 1 - Drivers Data
This research inquiry focusses on uncovering the consequences of driver substance abuse on the likelihood of a crash occurring. Utilizing binary classification techniques, namely Random Forest, this project strives to forecast whether "Driver Substance Abuse" plays a role in causing an accident. Furthermore, a more refined classification method utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) examines the ability to predict the "Injury Severity" associated with different collision events.
Dataset 2 - Incidents Data
For hit-and-run incidents, the author analysed the recognition of patterns within these occurrences, specifically in relation to environmental and road conditions. Through the implementation of Decision Tree, the author was able to anticipate if an incident is classified as a hit-and-run, a crucial aid in both law enforcement and traffic safety analysis. In addition, the author enlists Logistic Regression to forecast fault attribution, illustrating the key factors in crashes.
Dataset 3 - Police Dispatch Data
By utilizing powerful classification techniques, such as Gradient Boosting, the author can accurately predict the "Priority" levels of incidents based on the information recorded in police dispatch records. This valuable classification system helps to determine the level of urgency and type of incidents, resulting in a more effective distribution of resources and preparation for response.
The project evaluations involve comprehensive datasets containing vital information, such as crash specifics, meteorological conditions, road features, and law enforcement actions. Through a range of machine learning techniques, including Random Forrest, Decision Trees, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting, the author gains diverse insights into the factors surrounding collisions, generating a thorough grasp on the key elements responsible for road incidents in Montgomery County.
